title: "My identity [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

I try my best to keep a flexible identity because a fixed identity can hinder my progress. I don't identify myself as a good boy or a bad boy. I don't associate my identity with a particular language, profession, belief system, skin color, or even species classification.

But if I'm asked to anchor the essence of my existence to an idea, I'll choose this one: I'm one of those wilderness dwellers who decide to carry out the duty of holding the entropy of this universe as low as possible by creating and destroying systems.
