title: "Three survival rules"

1. Avoid fatal and lethal damage.
2. Inflict fatal or lethal damage
3. Flee from the scene of conflict

You won't be able to do all of these steps in some cases. And in those rare cases, your death might ensue.

Examples of such cases:

1. You won't be able to dodge bullets raining at you.
2. You won't be able to inflict any damage to radioactive waste.
3. You can't flee from aging (as far as I know).
