This post is about how I feel about leaving things to move forward, and about being left by those who move forward.

Mono no aware: a gentle realization that the beautiful sakura bloom will be gone in a short time, and the decision to be happy by accepting this ephemeral cherry blossom with a heart full of gratitude and appreciation.

Just an ordinary day
Just an ordinary morning
I wake up, eat up
I bath myself, dress myself
I go out
A graceful old woman sitting
“Good weather today, isn’t it?” “Yes it is.”
I get in
A beautiful friend passing
“Good weather today, isn’t it?” “Yes it is.”
I go home
My beloved mother calling
“Good weather today, isn’t it?” “Yes it is.”
Every day is always the same
