title: "The tale of two rivers"
---

Two men hang out at a small river. One of them said to the other "I'm going to change the course of this small river." And so, he went inside the river and started digging on the side of the river while his friend cheered him on. After some time the river changed direction.

Then the man who changed it said "I'm going to change the course of the big river over there. It'll be my life work and masterpiece." And so, he went inside the river and started digging on the side of the river while his friend cheered him on. But then, a strong river current came and swept this man away.

His friend mourned for him and said "Don't worry my friend. I'll change the course of this big river." And so he went to the side of the river and started digging from the land on the side of the river. After some time, the river changed its direction a little. He said "I changed the direction of this big river a little my friend. It might not be much but I dedicate this change for you." And he went away from that big river.
