title: "Money doesn't solve problem [Less Wrong Premise]"
---

I don't really know why, but we humans seem to have the default tendency to view money as a problem solver. If only I have money, all the problems in my life will disappear. If only the government throw more money into education, it'll become better. If only the higher-ups had allocated more money to our department, we would have been able to do what we're supposed to do. If we just throw money at nonprofit organizations, surely we'll have a much better society.

This may be a part of a greater tendency to look for an easy fix. If so, it's probably related to statements like: If only I am beautiful, then I'd become a happy person.

Well, money, or beauty, doesn't solve problems. People solve problem. Technology may help people to implement the solution. Money may help people in the implementation process.
