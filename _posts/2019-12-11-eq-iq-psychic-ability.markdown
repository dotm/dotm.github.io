title: "EQ + IQ = Psychic ability [Mental Technique]"

Good EQ creates good premises.

Good IQ creates good logical structures.

Having both means being able to make scarily accurate and well-structured arguments, inference, predictions, etc.

The tedious part is honing your EQ because it consists of many kinds of knowledge:

- knowing how you'll react to things
- knowing how people will react to things
- knowing why people react to things
- knowing the body language of people
- knowing what fallacies people usually make
- knowing how power flows
- knowing the ebbs and flows of societies and nations
- knowing how history repeats itself
- knowing how the universe moves
- and possibly many other pieces of knowledge

But the IQ is also important even though it consists of fewer kinds of mental artistry:

- knowing how to make sound logical conclusions
- knowing game theory for decision making and for seeing incentive structures

Both are equally important to gain a semblance of psychic ability.
