title: "How I decide what to do and what not to do [Keeping Symmetry]"

I do what I need to do. Then, I do what I want to do. But, I don't do things that violate the fundamental principles of the universe.

If you want me to do something, make me need or want to do it. But, be careful not to violate my free will, since doing as such is going against one of the principles of the universe.
