title: "Making a difference is not about lofty idealism"

Making a difference has a synonym: generating value.

Generating value is not about lofty idealism. It's about realistic survival.

When a crisis comes, organizations that survive are those who make a difference. Any organization that doesn't generate value will be killed. Any part of the surviving organization that doesn't generate value will be killed.

Strive to make a difference and you'll survive catastrophes.
