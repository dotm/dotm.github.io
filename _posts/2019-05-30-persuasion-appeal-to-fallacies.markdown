title: "Persuasion: appeal to fallacies [Technical Tips]"
---

Using fallacies is bad practice for decision making, yet people still use them. 

And so, while fallacies are bad when you're making a logical decision, you can use them to persuade or influence people.

It's easy for logic-oriented people to forget that fallacies play a big role in most people's decision-making process. They assume that since they're not swayed by logical fallacies, other people also wouldn't be swayed.

And that's another reason to learn common logical fallacies. Other than to avoid them when we make decisions, we can use them to persuade others by appealing to their fallacies.
