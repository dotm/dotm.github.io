Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.

I find it easy to interact with people who are humble. They recognize their weaknesses and accept it gracefully. They see the greatness in others and do not fear it. They might even strive to be great themselves.

I find it easy to interact with people who are kind to others. They might be envious, but they don't let their envy to manifest and hurt others. They care about others, and in return, others care about them.

I find it easy to interact with people who are rightfully confident and prideful (not insecure). They might look down on others a bit, but their ego is strong and their confidence is based on concrete facts. When you interact with them, you don't have to walk on eggshells (you don't have to watch your words too much).

I find it easy to interact with people who are brash. They might be a bit of a jerk, but they respect the strength of others. They might be painfully honest, but they don't lie to themselves either.
