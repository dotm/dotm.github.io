Ideation is not about creating an idea. It's about finding an idea that wants to exist right now. That's why a visionary is called a visionary, and not a thinker. 

Ideation is not about giving birth. It's about helping the universe to give birth to an idea that is dying to be born. And the way we can help the universe is not by becoming a midwife, but by becoming a channel through which the idea can emerge and manifest in real life.
