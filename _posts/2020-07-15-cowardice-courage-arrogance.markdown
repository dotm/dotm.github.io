title: "Cowardice, courage, arrogance. [Less Wrong Premise]"
---

We all can't see the future. We all don't know everything. We all can't do everything. We're all blind.

To be a coward is to sit down and do nothing. Just reveling in your blindness.

To be arrogant is to blindly march forward, thinking you see everything, when in fact you see nothing but darkness.

To be courageous is to walk slowly toward your goal. Knowing that you know nothing ahead of you. Trying your best to see with your eyes. Getting help and guidance from other people.
