title: "About strategy and tactics"
---

To do strategy is to put your self (or organization) in a place where opportunities abound.

To do tactics is to seize an opportunity when it came close.

Learning strategy is about learning major things like macroeconomics, the flow of politics, social trends, coordinating your troops in the battlefield, developing your chess pieces, etc.

Learning tactics is about learning minor things like microeconomics, social techniques (persuading, negotiating, making conversations, etc.), killing enemies, making a double attack in chess, etc.

Both are important in the pursuit of the main objective(s) such as making money, getting power or connections, winning in war or on the chess table, etc.
