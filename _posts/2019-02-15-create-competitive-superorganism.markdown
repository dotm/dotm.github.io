title: "Ways to create extremely competitive superorganism"
---

One person is no match for a hundred person. A corrupt monarchy is no match to a meritocratic colony.

It seems to me currently that the key to extremely competitive superorganism is to create a system that can encourage as many organisms as possible to move in sync toward a goal.

It also seems to me that currently there are two paradigms to achieve this.

- the one-man team paradigm where a single consciousness decides everything and all the other consciousnesses follow
- the incentive structure paradigm where a single structure governs the way organisms move so that they don't end up killing each other

Which one is better? I don't know. Let the best paradigm win. And the best paradigm is the one that can create more competitive superorganism.

It may also be the case that a combination of both is the most optimal way of creating extremely awesome superorganisms.
