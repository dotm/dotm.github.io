title: "My biggest regret"

What's my biggest regret? Well, that's easy to answer. 

I regret not accepting all things sooner. If I accept myself sooner, accept the world sooner, and accept my duty sooner, I'd be in for a lot less pain and a lot more fun in life. But, what's done is done. I just need to be thankful I don't start even later.
