title: "The hidden structures of unconventional art pieces"
---

Every coherent art has at least one structure.

Some structures are easy to spot: the number of syllables in a haiku poem, the four beats in a bar of a song, the rhyming words of multiple phrases, etc.

Some structures, however, are harder to see: a feeling, a fleeting moment, a particular season, a way of moving our body, an idea, any idea.

A song based on the feeling you get when watching the bright color of a lightbulb. A dance based on a winter sickness. A poem based on the moment you wait for an answer from your friend. A drama based on the interaction of subatomic particle. A painting based on the idea of nothing.

When you use such hidden structures in your artwork, it'll become a bit strange; a bit different. This is especially true if you don't use any of the obvious, conventional structures of your art form. People will wonder why such art piece is coherent when there's seemingly no structure holding it together.

While subverting convention can be refreshing, do be careful with strangeness. If your weird piece connects with people, it'll be called a unique masterpiece. If it becomes so strange it starts to alienate people, it'll just be an eccentric art piece, or worse, an aberrant noise that doesn't even count as art.
