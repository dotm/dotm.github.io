title: "A good way to live"
---

The way to good society is the good living of its entire people. The way to good living is simple: take as needed, eat as needed, give as needed.

Some people take for the sake of taking. They have too much, eat too little, and give almost nothing. If these people are not reined in, society will freeze and die.

Some people eat for the sake of pleasure. They take as much as they eat and they eat too much. If these people are not reined in, society will wither and die.

Some people give too much and eat too little. They pay no heed to their limit for giving and to society’s limit for taking. If these people are not reined in, society will burst and die.

Note: I write like I know everything here, but, the fact is, I’m not even certain I really know what I think I know. However, littering the post with “maybe” and “probably” will make it uglier, so yeah… By the way, “society” here can probably be replaced with other types of organization (e.g. business).
