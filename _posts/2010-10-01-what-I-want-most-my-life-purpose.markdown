title: "What do I want most? My life purpose [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

What is the thing I want most? It's not to be the same as everybody, nor to be different than everybody, neither to be better than everybody. It's not the admiration of distinction, nor pleasure from hedonism, neither power over others.

The thing I want most, the thing I hunt for, is to spend my life having sustainable fun by:

- making good art
- learning how to make good art
- teaching how to make good art

How much I want those? I want to do them bad enough that if you want to stop me, I can only give you one tip: erase my existence. Taking half of my body won't be enough. Taking all my limbs might be enough (maybe). But as long as I can function, I'll hunt for what I want with whatever I've got left.

Why do I want those so bad?

- because they are eternity-proof (I can do it for all eternity and still have fun)
- because it's a God-proof way of life (if God doesn't exist, I had my fun; if God exists, I made good arts.)
- because of my gratitude to those who have come before me (whose masterpieces benefit my life greatly)
- to help connect masterpieces from the past to masterpieces of the future

If possible, I'll have sustainable fun with others who can synergize, so that we can make good art together, because synergy makes self-actualization more fun.
