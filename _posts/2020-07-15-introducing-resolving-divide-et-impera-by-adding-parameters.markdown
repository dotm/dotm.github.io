title: "Introducing and resolving divide et impera by adding parameters"
---

The strategy of divide et impera (divide and rule) is simply a case of adding a new parameter to solve a problem.

The problem is: how do we conquer this solid (hard-to-manipulate) societal mass without much effort.

The solution is: add a new parameter of separation (cultural, racial, economic, religious, etc.) so that the solid mass becomes more fragile, then we can conquer it easily.

To resolve a case of divide et impera, we also need to go meta and introduce a new parameter. For example, we can introduce a unifying figure, an exceptional event might happen that force people to set aside their differences, etc.

To forbid the practice of divide et impera, we also need to go meta and introduce systems or structures that can discourage or even restrict that kind of practice.
