title: "Delusion trick [Mental Technique]"
---
There’s a quotation saying that “If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.” Here’s a catch: I know of a way so that you don’t have to tell the truth nor remember anything. You can achieve this by using a false belief to create a delusion. Let me elaborate.

Delusion here means a persistent false belief regarding the self or persons or objects outside the self that is maintained despite indisputable evidence to the contrary.

The process is very simple in theory, if you have the prerequisites. Everyone have false beliefs, so try to spot one that you can use. If you can’t find any delusion that you can use, create the false belief yourself. Once you have one false belief that you can use, reinforce it continually until it becomes a delusion. You know you have succeed when your target continue to belief his false belief despite contrary evidence that he encounters. 

One advantage of this technique is that, unlike lying, once you succeed in creating delusions, you don’t have to remember which delusions you had create to whom. Even if you slip multiple times, your target will still believe his delusions. Most of the time, it takes a very dramatic event for a delusion to shed off.

Another advantage is that most people will still be deceived even if they know how the trick works, even if they've been the victim of this technique multiple times. This is because their pride of not wanting to be wrong, their firm attachment to their belief, and other forces coming from inside them will conspire and blind them when you start the delusion making process.

As any technique, this technique is not perfect and has its own weaknesses. One of them is that the bigger the number of your target (yes, you can use this technique on multiple targets at the same time), the simpler the false beliefs that you need to use. If you only want to target one people, then you can make more elaboration to the delusion. 

This doesn’t mean that there’ll be no problem if you only target one delusion per people. Some people will be quick to bite your delusions, while other will seems to take forever. Plus some people have a certain characteristics that make them practically immune to this technique. Therein lays another problem with multiple targeting: your technique is bound to fail on some people.

Another disadvantage of this technique is that you need to have the prerequisites implied in the process and they may be hard to acquire. Here’re some of them:

- Knowing a multitude of delusions so you can spot them in your targets
- Knowing how to create a false belief using means that are available to you
- Knowing how to reinforce a false belief and having the patience to do so

I won’t tell you how or where to acquire these prerequisites because of my laziness. But, at least, now you know what questions to ask so that you can acquire these prerequisites and the process required to execute this technique once you obtain the answers to your questions.
