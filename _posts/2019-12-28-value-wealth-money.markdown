Money is a form of wealth. Other forms of wealth are properties, stocks, etc. This is because wealth can be defined as valuable possessions.

Wealth is a form of value. Other forms of value are skills, social status, political power, attractiveness, etc. These things have value because they are deemed valuable.

As you can see, one is a generalization of another.

And the main point of view here is third-person. Money, wealth, value is useful only when we interact with another party.
