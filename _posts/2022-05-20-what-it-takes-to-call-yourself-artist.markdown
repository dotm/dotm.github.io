title: "What it takes to call yourself an artist"
---

Please note that this is just my personal opinion.

Artists need to understand the principles of their medium, the nature of the materials that they use, and the capabilities of their tools.

Example of medium: music.

Example of principles: consistency-variety (music shouldn't be too consistent that it become boring, nor too varied that it become random noises).

Example of the nature of the materials: major scale is happy, minor scale is happy, etc.

Examples of tools: musical instruments, DAWs, VST/AU plugins, etc.

From these, they can derive the product and the process (workflow) that creates the product.

The product here means the real-world manifestation of the ideas that exist in the art space. The workflow here means the process of giving birth to those ideas through the artist's medium.
Without going through this process, the result will not be art. It might be a high-quality performance, a top-selling craft, but it's not art.

The only way I can think of to have such an artistic vision is to eat mud and drink bleach. Eat mud here means to see all things about humanity, both the good, the bad, and the weird side. To drink bleach here means to process it in a way that is non-destructive to your psyche or even poetic to other people. Once you do these, then you can access the art space and find your artistic vision.
