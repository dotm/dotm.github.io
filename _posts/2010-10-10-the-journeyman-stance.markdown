title: "The journeyman stance [Keeping Symmetry]"

> I will not give false hope of stability and predictability. But I will give value as much as I'm able and willing to give. I don't say "just enough" value to make me tolerable. I'm willing to give a lot because I care about my skills and art. I say as much value as the other party is willing to receive because sometimes I can give much more value than what the other party can receive.

This is my journeyman stance.

This statement stands as long as I am a journeyman, mercenary, hunter, or whatever the hell you want to call people who are paid for the skill they have and the art they make.
