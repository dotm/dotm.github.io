title: "Emulating the universe's personality [Mental Technique]"
---

Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs; the sage is ruthless and treats the people as straw dogs.

Emulating this 'ruthless' characteristic of the universe is often useful.

Don't treat people with favoritism. The universe gives rain and sunshine to everyone.

Don't bore ill intent toward others. The universe doesn't hate people even though they defile it with pollutions.

However, when the universe needs something to get done, it gets it done even if many people will suffer. It said "I'm gonna make a tsunami here. Oh, the people on this island doesn't have working tsunami detector because some bad citizens vandalize it? Well, too bad. People will die then."

And while it doesn't bore ill intent, the universe will give consequences consistently. "Oh, you decide to pollute my air with smog? It's fine guys. By the way, can your lungs inhale smog and not get sick?"

Emulating this ruthless character is often the best way to act as a wise human, especially when you're given the power to rule over others.
