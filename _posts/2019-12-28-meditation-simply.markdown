Meditation: telling your mind to do things.

Meditation is done so you become the master of your mind and not the other way around. This is because the mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.

There are many types of meditation because there are many things you can ask your mind to do.

The simplest one is to tell your mind to focus on your breathing.

But there are other things you can ask:

- hear the voice of your surrounding
- reflect on your deeds this week
- focus on a mantra
- feel the touch on your skin
- contemplate the laws that bind both humans and God
- anything that stops your mind from wandering on its own
