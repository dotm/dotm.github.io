title: "Handling crisis with ANC model [Mental Technique]"
---

A very useful model to handle crisis is the Aviate-Navigate-Communicate Model. This model is commonplace among pilots.

The most important thing to do is to aviate, which means we must always maintain positive control of the system. In simple words, we must keep things operating as usual. 

Aviating always comes first, if the crisis is solved but the system collapse, then game's over.

One challenge of aviating in crisis is avoiding fixation. We must avoid being so engrossed by the perceived problem that no one is actively running the system. Fixation to minor failures can cause catastrophic accident.

If you must, delegate to someone or to a team to work on the crisis, while everybody else focus on running the systems as usual.

The next thing after aviating is navigating. You must know where you are, and you must know the terrain and situation around you. You also must know where you’re heading to solve the crisis and you must have a plan so that you can get there.

Make you are on your toes when navigating through crisis. Make sure you're still staying on the path, moving forward through the crisis, and avoiding or navigating around dangerous obstacles. Always ask "What's next?" and always stay (look) ahead of the system.

After navigating, comes communicating. You must communicate  about the crisis with various stakeholders.

While the type of communication will vary with each group, it's important to be clear, concise, and communicate all the necessary details.

Always maintain open lines of communications and if possible be as transparent as possible.

While you can’t control the flow of information, you can take a proactive role in shaping it by maintaining transparency and actively working to communicate with your audience that:

-  you are aware that a problem exists
-  you care about their concerns
-  you empathize and are apologetic
-  you are working toward a solution

In some cases, frequent updates are a must. People want to know that their concerns are being heard.
