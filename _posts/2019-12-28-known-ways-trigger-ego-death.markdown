title: "Known ways to trigger ego death"

What ego-death is to me: when the bubble of self that your mind actively maintain bursts, you'll be fearless to everything because you realize you're one with everything.

1. Live like a monk for an extended period. This is the safest way, but it takes a lot of time.
2. Use psychedelic and hope you get an ego-death experience instead of some kind of bad trip. This is the most effortless way, but also the most unreliable way.
3. Snap out of an intense enough depression (whether acute or chronic). This is the most stressful way, but also the way many people know that ego-death is a thing.

There's also a reported case of a woman experiencing ego-death when she has internal bleeding inside her brain. I don't include this to the list above for obvious reasons (e.g. it's hard to replicate safely).

Why would you want to trigger an ego-death experience? Well, you don't have to, but I believe that experiencing it gave me some perspective on things.
