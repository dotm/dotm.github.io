title: "My current priorities [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

In accordance with the sacrifices of those who came before me, the responsibility that I have choose for myself, and my sustainable fun and improvement, I need to remember that these are my current priorities.

The importance of these priorities are to be held above the importance of my own life and comfort, but NOT above my own soul. Losing my life or experiencing tragedy for these priorities are fine. Losing my soul for these priorities are not.

From 2015 onward, the priorities are:

-  Survive
-  Train hard
-  Move toward the frontier and wait for further instructions
