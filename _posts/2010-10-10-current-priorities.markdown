title: "My current priorities [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

Considering the sacrifices of kindred souls who came before me, the responsibility that I've chosen for myself, my own sustainable fun and improvement, and the instructions and guidances that I've received incrementally from the universe, I need to remember that these are my current priorities.

These priorities are more important than my own life and comfort, but NOT more important than my own soul. Losing my life or experiencing tragedies for these priorities is fine. Losing my soul for these priorities is not fine.

From 2022 onward, the priorities are:

- Start working toward my first masterpiece.
- Make as many friends as possible.
- Survive and keep the soul intact
- Train hard to be able to contribute to significant artworks when the time comes
- Learn as many generalist skills and knowledge as time allows

From 2018 onward, the priorities are:

- Move toward the frontier and wait for further instructions
- Find and befriend those who are not threatened by my existence
- Survive and keep the soul intact
- Train hard to be able to contribute to significant artworks when the time comes
- Learn as many generalist skills and knowledge as time allows

From 2015 onward, the priorities are:

- Survive and keep the soul intact
- Train hard to be able to contribute to significant artworks when the time comes
- Learn as many generalist skills and knowledge as time allows

Before 2015, the priorities are:

- Learn as many generalist skills and knowledge as time allows
