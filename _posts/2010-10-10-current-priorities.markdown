title: "My current priorities [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

In accordance with the sacrifices of the kindred souls who came before me, with the responsibility that I have choose for myself, and for my own sustainable fun and improvement, I need to remember that these are my current priorities.

The importance of these priorities are to be held above the importance of my own life and comfort, but NOT above my own soul. Losing my life or experiencing tragedies for these priorities are fine. Losing my soul for these priorities are not fine.

From 2015 onward, the priorities are:

-  Survive and keep the soul intact
-  Train hard
-  Move toward the frontier and wait for further instructions

Note to self: Don't mind too much about the people who can't even see my existence, you'll end up killing yourself in the manner of some of those who came before me.
