title: "My current priorities [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

Considering the sacrifices of kindred souls who came before me, the responsibility that I have chosen for myself, and my own sustainable fun and improvement, I need to remember that these are my current priorities.

These priorities are more important than my own life and comfort, but NOT more important than my own soul. Losing my life or experiencing tragedies for these priorities is fine. Losing my soul for these priorities is not fine.

From 2018 onward, the priorities are:
-  Survive and keep the soul intact
-  Train hard to be able to contribute to significant artworks when the time comes
-  Find and befriend those who are not threatened by my full existence
-  Move toward the frontier and wait for further instructions

Note to self: Don't mind too much about the people who can't even see or don't want to see your full existence, you'll end up getting depressed and killing yourself like some of those who came before you.
