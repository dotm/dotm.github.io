title: "Using incentive structure to force goodness (handling sociopathy) [Mental Technique]"
---

There's one way that I know (there may be others) to force sociopaths to do good without negating their free will: well-aligned incentive structures.

Sociopaths are intelligent enough to see incentive structures. Idealistically, if we can create the correct incentive structure where it is impossible to benefit one own's self at the loss of others, we can make sociopaths to do good things willingly, because doing good will then be the only way to benefit one's self.

The reality, however, is that sociopaths will try to mess with the incentive structure to gain even more benefits for their own self than what is possible with the well-aligned incentive structures. And since they are intelligent enough to see incentive structures, they'll be intelligent enough to mess it up.

The thing that keeping this from going out of control is the intelligent people who fight to preserve or create well-aligned incentive structures. When intelligent people stop fighting for a structure, sociopaths will rule it. 

This battle is always ongoing and the side that will eventually win depends on the stance of the universe. If the universe decides that cooperative synergy is the way to go, then intelligent people will win. If the universe decides that ruthless backstabbing competition is the way to go, then sociopaths will win.
