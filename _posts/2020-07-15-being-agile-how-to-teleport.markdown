title: "Being agile (how to teleport) [Technical Tips]"

Agility consists mainly of these factors:
current kinetic energy, current potential energy, ability to change the direction of the kinetic energy, ability to convert potential energy into kinetic energy.

The ideal, best kind of agility is when you can stand still in one moment and move to another faraway place the next moment.
This is often called as teleportation.

This is mostly impossible because doing this will cause extreme stress to a system that can break the system.
The ability to withstand the stress of change thus is one example of the components to convert potential to kinetic energy.

Having a high amount of kinetic energy is also important because that means the system doesn't experience as much stress when it tries to increase its speed to a certain point.

Aside from that, we usually have limited potential energy to convert at any given moment. So, having a large amount of potential energy is also important.

While speed is the core of agility, we also need to be able to change direction quickly because going somewhere wrong fast is often as helpful as going nowhere.

To maximize all the factors above is to strive for agility.

When you can fully maximize all of the factors above (except maybe current kinetic energy), you will be able to teleport.

By the way, I was lying when I said teleportation is the best kind of agility. The best kind of agility is when you can move really fast in one direction at one moment, and then move in the opposite direction with the same speed at the next moment.
