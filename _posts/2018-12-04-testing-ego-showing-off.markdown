title: "Testing other's ego by showing off [Mental Technique]"
---

I'm not the kind of guy that gets high when complimented. I figure that if I care enough about what people say (that I get high when complimented), then I'd crash drown when I get mocked.

People like me are polarizing. Some people will say nasty enough thing. And if I care too much, I'd end up killing myself (and possibly a few other people).

But I often show off (flex) my skills.

I don't show off on social media, because my intention is not to be complimented, gain followers, etc. I show off in real life to test people's egos. I figured out that it's too tiring to interact too much with people that have too fragile egos. I need to hide my skills, watch my words, lower my head, etc. Hence, I polarize them to see which ones are insecure and which ones are not. Then I limit my interactions with insecure people and spend more time with emotionally secure people.

I won't show off money, status, or women because my intention is not to make people envious, to make them latch on to me because of what I have, etc. I show off my skill because I want to attract other people who are as committed to their craft as I do to my craft so that we can get together and do fun things together.
