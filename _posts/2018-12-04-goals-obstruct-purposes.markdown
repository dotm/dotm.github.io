title: "Don't let goals obstruct purposes [Keeping Symmetry]"
---

Goals have a hierarchy.

I call the parent goal "purpose." Each purpose has multiple children (which I call here as "goals") that help in reaching the purpose.

The top-most purpose is life purpose. Below it is many long-term goals as children, such as relationship goal, career goal, etc. Each of this long-term goal is a purpose that consists of multiple children goals. For example, to be a great pro athlete (career goal as a purpose), I need to follow this training schedule (a children goal), I need to have this diet (another children goal), etc.

Don't let the pursuit of any children goal obstruct the pursuit of the purpose above it.

If a children goal no longer helps you to get closer to your purpose, get rid of it.
