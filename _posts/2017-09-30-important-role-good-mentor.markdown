title: "The important role of good mentor (in providing guidance to reach our real goals)"
---

TL; DR: Beginners don’t know what they really wanted (their real goals); instead, they fantasize about their goals (fake goals). A good, kind mentor will appeal to the beginner’s fake aspirations, all the while guiding them to their real aspirations. Once the tutoring is done, the beginner will realize that his master had deceived him since he doesn’t actually reach his (fake) goals. But, he will be thankful to his mentor, since the mentor had guide him to reach what he actually, truly wants (his real goals).

A fat, short, ugly guy struggles with getting girls, so he decided to find a mentor to teach him. Luckily, a good, qualified mentor is willing to teach him. The mentor said “Buy my book first. It’s a book called ‘Getting your dream girl.’ Buy it and I will teach you if you’re willing.” So the ugly guy bought the book, and not only that, he did everything his good mentor said. He is a good apprentice studying with a good mentor. While he’s learning, he sometimes fantasized about his dream girl: a hot, beautiful, submissive supermodel that he can flaunt around in public. This motivates him greatly. So, he learned hard until he become really attractive. And then, years later he finished being a mentee and his mentor stop teaching him full time. However, he didn’t get the supermodel he wanted. So in one sense, the mentor had failed him in teaching him on how to get his dream girl. Instead, he was married to a kind girl that he’s attracted to, that he connects with, that accepts him. And he realized that he’s actually happy. Maybe this is the dream girl that he truly wanted. In this sense, the mentor didn’t lie to him when he said that he will teach the guy to get his dream girl.

Now go back and read the TL; DR.

Interesting thought experiment: Let’s assume that heaven exists as our goal. Let’s assume that God, Buddha, etc. is our mentor who provides guidance in the form of religion. Then heaven probably is not the utopia we think it to be, nor is it the utopia that’s advertised by our mentor (religions). So the question is: what kind of utopia heaven is? In other words, what do we truly want?
