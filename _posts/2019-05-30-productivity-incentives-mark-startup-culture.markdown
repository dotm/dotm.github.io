One of the key differentiators of startup culture is how an organization incentivizes value generation of its employees.

When an employee works above the expected job description, is he rewarded appropriately (e.g. with money, stocks, positions, connections, benefits, etc.) or is he rewarded mockingly (e.g. with a meaningless "employee of the month" award, with a pat on the back, etc.)?

Let's get honest, people who are rewarded mockingly might take the reward happily because it boosts their ego. But other people know that doing more work for little return is stupid.

As employees, we need to do our best to work and create value. We then need to have faith that our employers will reward us fairly. And when they don't, we'll know that it isn't a startup, even if we are working in a small company.

Startup culture is not about size. It's about the culture that emerges from the structures of the organization. One of those structures is a correct incentive system for productivity.
