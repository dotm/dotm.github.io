title: "Learning is fun if you design your life as a game"
---

I love gaming. Most kids love games.

When I was a teenager, I have a question and answer discussion with my self.

Why do I spend so much time and effort to master a video game that I'll stop playing in just a couple of months? It's because playing video games is fun.

Why are games (or at least, some games) fun? It's because they're designed to be fun.

Okay. But even if playing games are fun, they don't give me significant advantages in real life. Having an intelligent in-game character won't make you more successful in life, will it? Yes, I know that. But learning (cultivating real-life skills) is not as fun as playing video games even if I know that learning real-life skills is better than mastering video games.

Can I make learning fun? Well, I suppose I can try learning how to make learning fun. Maybe I'll be able to design my life as a fun game of learning just like the game designer design a fun video game.

Great. Let's try to work it out. Let's make learning fun.
