---

People don't want to deal with any messiness if possible. But, the real world is inherently messy. And so, people tend to gravitate to less messy professions and careers.

The statements above imply that:

- the demand for clearing messiness will always exist
- the supply for clearing messiness will be low

Hence, there is always money near messiness.

Art is less messy than business. People mostly prefer to be an artist. But the money is mostly better in business.

Science is less messy than engineering. Most geniuses want to contribute to science. But, being an engineer pays better.

Sport is less messy than plumbing. Many kids dream of being an athlete. But, plumbing is a steady job.
