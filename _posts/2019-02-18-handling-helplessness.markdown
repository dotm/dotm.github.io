title: "Keeping good people from burning out (handling helplessness) [Mental Technique]"
---

Helpless people are "good" people. They give selflessly. They readily take a loss so others could benefit. These are noble and all until they burn themselves out and become useless (either by leaving your team or by becoming an empty shell).

The way to keep them alive, healthy, and happy is not that hard. Just set reasonable expectations from them and don't let them go above it. For example, ask them to work 8 hours a day and don't let them work more hours. This way, you can keep them as good contributors.

Don't try to exploit them by taking advantage of their kindness. They might not complain or reject you. But, they will take notes and avoid you in the future if they can.
