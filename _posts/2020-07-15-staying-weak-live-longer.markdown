**Sometimes leveling up (getting stronger, faster, better, etc.) will make it harder to reach your goal.**

The graph sometimes is shaped not like this `/`, but like this `∩`. This means that after a certain point, getting better will diminish your chances of hitting the goal.

That's it. That's the idea that I want to convey. But here're some example:

- Working out too often can make you less healthy
- Leveling up in a video game can make it harder to win a match
- Being richer or more powerful can make you less safe
- Being more attractive can get you fewer dates
- Having more friends can make you less happy
- Being promoted to that high-level position can make you less satisfied with your job
- etc.
