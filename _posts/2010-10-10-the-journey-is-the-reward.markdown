title: "The journey is the reward [Keeping Symmetry]"

The journey is the reward. The process is more important than the result. And the only sustainable process is the one where you have fun.

I whisper this thing to myself every night. Trying to remember that the most important thing is having fun and not achieving great things. Because if I forget, I will become miserable, agonizing over what I could become and what I can do, instead of getting excited about what I could become and what I can do.

I say this thing to myself every day. I'm NOT the kind of guy who ambitiously runs toward a goal and tries hard to achieve it. I'm the kind of guy who passionately does things that I consider fun.

Once, I found things that I consider fun, I'd do it day-by-day, every day. Putting milestones and goals only to make sure I progress steadily (not because I think goals are important in and of itself). Progressing steadily only because it's more fun than standing still (not because I stressed out over progress).

With discipline, I have fun every day. Until one day, years later, "suddenly" I find myself doing crazy awesome things with my crazy awesome capability.

I whisper this thing to myself at night every day. Trying to make myself believe that it's what I am. Because day-by-day, this wish will come true little by little if I believe and do as such. Because one day, years later, this wish may actually become reality if I believe and do as such.
