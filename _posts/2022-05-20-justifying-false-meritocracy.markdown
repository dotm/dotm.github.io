People don't get what they want. They don't get what they deserve. They get what they successfully take.

So how should we operate ethically in such an unfair system?

If you really want to take something, you must fight hard to deserve it first. And then once you deserve it, you're justified to use all necessary means to take it.

If you get something without deserving it first, then you must fight hard to deserve it after you get it. This way those who deserve it won't spite you too much.

Do be careful of what the word deserve means here. Just because you put in a lot of effort, doesn't mean you deserve it. Customers care about the end product, people care about the value you give to them. If you have given enough value, then you deserve to get the reward for it.
