title: "Time constraint is an illusion"
---

I always regret it when I clearly know what I need to do but I don’t do it for whatever reasons. And the most common reason for that is pressure. Not social pressure by peers (since I walk mostly solo), but time pressure.

The solution to this time pressure, I found, is to realize that in the face of time, nothing matters. This helps me focus less on “Can I do it in time?” and more on “I’ll do what I can.”

I don’t need to do it quickly. I just need to do it as best as I can. If I stressed out, I’d do it badly, and I’ll fail anyway. I might as well focus on doing it well, and hope for the best.

In front of death, the constraint of time is an illusion, because failure is ultimately irrelevant.

For a more practical advice: when the time is short, then cut out the non-essential stuff, focus on things that matter most, plan your steps, and do the plan well. **Do smaller things step-by-step. Never hurry.**
