    <p>Asterisk (*) means that there's proof available on request (so that thou mayest know that I ain't BS-ing).</p>

    <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>
    <p>In essence: learn fast with comprehension, build fast with quality</p>
    <p>Learn fast by striving for understanding and spending time to improve myself professionally (even outside of work)</p>
    <p>Code fast by upholding high quality and using the right tools (and design) for the right problem</p>
    
    <h2>Current Skill Level</h2>
    <p>I understand the importance of quality, readability, and reusability in speeding up the development process.</p>
    <p>I can learn things on my own pretty fast as a software developer, since I can read the English documentation of any particular technology pretty easily</p>
    <p>I understand common design patterns (e.g. Observer, Strategy, Command, etc.) and architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM, Unidirectional Data Flow, etc.). I use them (sparingly) to create components and even the core of applications.</p>
    <p>I'm comfortable with both Object-Oriented Programming (Python and Swift) and Functional Programming (Haskell and Javascript).</p>
    <p>I've learned 6+ general programming languages and I'm quite confident that I can pick any popular programming language pretty quickly.</p>
    <p>I can collaborate with other teammates both in ideation and implementation. I can also organize and delegate programming tasks to my teammates.</p>
    <p>As of 2018, I'm still learning about testing, security, scalability, low-level programming, and system design.</p>
