      <h2>Current Skill Level</h2>
      <p>General Programming and Development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As of 2018, I'm still learning about testing, security, scalability, low-level programming, and system design.</li>
        <li>-------------</li>
        <li>I understand the importance of quality, readability, and reusability in speeding up the development process.</li>
        <li>I can learn things on my own pretty fast as a software developer since I can read the English documentation of any particular technology pretty easily.</li>
        <li>I'm comfortable with both Object-Oriented Programming (Python and Swift) and Functional Programming (Haskell and Javascript).</li>
        <li>I understand the importance of design principles such as SOLID to keep the code base maintainable. I'm able to use techniques and design patterns (such as Dependency Injection) to follow good design principles.</li>
        <li>I understand common Object-Oriented design patterns (such as Observer, Strategy, Command, etc.) and architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM, Unidirectional Data Flow, etc.). I use them (sparingly) to create components and even the core of applications.</li>
        <li>I understand common Functional Programming design patterns (Higher-Order Functions, Currying, Monad, Tagged Union/Algebraic Data Types) from my experience with Haskell.</li>
        <li>I understand asynchronous event-driven programming from my experience with JavaScript ES6: callback, promise, async await.</li>
        <li>I've learned 6+ general-purpose programming languages and I'm quite confident that I can pick any popular programming language pretty quickly.</li>
        <li>I can collaborate with other teammates both in ideation and implementation. I can also organize and delegate programming tasks to my teammates.</li>
        <li>I have experience working using Scrum.</li>

      <p>iOS Development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have experience publishing universal app on the App Store with Ads and In-App Purchase (see my Projects).</li>
        <li>I've fully read the human interface guidelines. I don't memorize it, but I know where to find things there for references.</li>
        <li>I'm proficient with Swift (optional, protocol, generic, ARC, extension, etc.)</li>
        <li>I can use CocoaPod (I also have experience with Ruby and RubyGems which helps)</li>
        <li>I can create an app programmatically without Interface Builder</li>
        <li>I have experience on using TestFlight and Firebase (Authentication, FireStore, Storage, AdMob)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Web Development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm proficient with the HTML language and understand how the DOM works (more or less).</li>
        <li>I'm proficient with CSS and understand the importance of BEM in large projects. (I even use BEM in this site)</li>

        <li>I can use React and Redux</li>
        <li>I can connect front-end to a back-end through RESTful API</li>
      </ul>
