  <p>Welcome to my blog!
    This blog is primarily a journal/diary of my mental life written as a documentation for my future self.
    Go to <strong>All Posts</strong> below to check all the posts I've written.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>A friendly warning to other people who are not me: </strong>
    <br>
    Anytime you feel that I'm being too harsh or rude in my posts,
    please remember that the 'you' written on the post refers specifically to me (Yoshua Elmaryono) and not you.
    If you feel offended by any of my post, please realize that it's not my intention to offend anybody.
    <br>
    All in all, this is <em>my</em> journal. If you don't like it, then there are so many blogs that you can read instead of mine.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you disagree with me, use the "Email Me" at the bottom of the page to contact me.</li>
    <li>If you agree or want to comment, Email Me.</li>
    <li>If you have something to add, Email Me and I may consider adding it to my post.</li>
    <li>If you think the title of a post doesn't match the post (If you caught yourself thinking "Oh, I thought this post is about X when I see the title. It seems it is about Y instead."), then Email Me and I will consider clarifying the title more.</li>
    <li>There'll be grammar and spelling mistakes. If the mistake muddles the content, correction will be appreciated (Email Me). If it doesn't, then just let it be (nothing is perfect).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you Email Me, please remember to add relevant information, such as relevant post title, relevant paragraph in that post, etc.
    And whatever you do, please remember to <em>keep things civil</em>.
